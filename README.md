# lua-RandomMorpher
Code written in lua for Azerothcore by Krisande! (it should also be compatible with Trinitycore!)

The purpose of this lua plug and play module is to provide a morpher npc which is able to morph the player as well as the players pet (if he has one) random into another display id.
Code is well documented which makes editing very easy =)

Have fun with the Morpher! =D
